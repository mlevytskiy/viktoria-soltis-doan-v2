                  A heartwarming story about Grandma Astrid and her pet Dragon. The Dragon is quite challenging at first
                  but read on and you will find how their unique friendship develops. Great lessons, so great book. The
                  illustrations are amazing throughout the book!

                  This book is a great way to introduce the joys and responsibilities of pet ownership to young people.
                  I went over this book with my daughter before we got her kitten so that she would have a better sense
                  of what to expect. I would definitely recommend any parent thinking about getting a pet for their
                  child!

                  A funny and dynamic story about a grandmother and her pet Dragon. This is a great way to teach
                  children that pets are not toys. They cannot be returned to the store. Pets need and deserve real love
                  and care!
